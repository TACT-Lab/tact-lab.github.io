<strong>Thank you for your interest in TACT lab!</strong>

If you are looking for a <strong>research internship</strong>, please read <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSec-TJp1SAV_e76zzn3NzqMY3RN3Y-Hmbnr7LINENSKGSkhQA/viewform">this form</a> carefully and submit an application if you are still interested. In the past two and a half years, we were able to have eleven amazing interns and all interns led their own research projects.

If you are looking for <strong>graduate thesis/project advising</strong>, please send me an email with the topic you'd like to explore so we can discuss the topic and research plan for the semester. I usually put much attention in early stage of the project (even before the semester). Please start communicating your plan as early as possible. An application on the portal without pre-discussion can be declined.

If you are interested in <strong>MS/Ph.D. position</strong> in my group, every year I take 1-2 graduate students supported by the government scholarship (free tuition fee).
However, I hardly consider applicants without prior research experience with me unless they have a strong recommendation from a professional researcher in related fields. Thus, if you are interested in joining MS/Ph.D. program, I strongly recommend considering a research internship in my group so that both you and I can see whether there's a good fit not only in research interests and skills but also in working style, lab culture, etc. Please understand that this is because the *fit* is one of the key factors for your successful graduate school life. If you have any related question, please send me an email.



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
