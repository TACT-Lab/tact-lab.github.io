<strong>Thank you for your interest in TACT lab!</strong>

If you are looking for a <strong>research internship</strong>, please read <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSec-TJp1SAV_e76zzn3NzqMY3RN3Y-Hmbnr7LINENSKGSkhQA/viewform">this form</a> carefully and submit an application if you are still interested. In the past two and a half years, we were able to have eleven amazing interns and all interns led their own research projects.

If you are looking for <strong>graduate thesis/project advising</strong>, please send me an email with the topic you'd like to explore so we can discuss the topic and research plan for the semester. I usually put much attention in early stage of the project (even before the semester). Please start communicating your plan as early as possible. An application on the portal without pre-discussion can be declined.

If you are interested in <strong>MS/Ph.D. position</strong> in my group, every year I take 1-2 graduate students supported by the government scholarship (free tuition fee).
However, I hardly consider applicants without prior research experience with me unless they have a strong recommendation from a professional researcher in related fields. Thus, if you are interested in joining MS/Ph.D. program, I strongly recommend considering a research internship in my group so that both you and I can see whether there's a good fit not only in research interests and skills but also in working style, lab culture, etc. Please understand that this is because the *fit* is one of the key factors for your successful graduate school life. If you have any related question, please send me an email.
