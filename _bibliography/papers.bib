  title={Diversifying grain-based compliance illusion by varying base compliance},
  author={Buyoung Mun and Junsu Lee and Jiseong Kim and Seongkook Heo and Jaeyeon Lee},
  abstract={Grain-based compliance illusion mimics the mechanical vibrations that occur when a compliant object deforms with grain-like, short (∼15 ms) impulse-response vibrations. Previous work has demonstrated its robust effect on various types of devices. However, the impact of the device’s inherent compliance (i.e., base compliance) on perceived compliance remains unclear. This paper investigates the influence of base compliance on the perception of illusory compliance through three psychophysical experiments. The results show that (1) the compliance illusion remained effective with base compliance, (2) the description of compliance was affected by both illusory and base compliance, and (3) it is possible to render the compliance with the same magnitude but multiple different feelings.},

  title={QuadStretcher: A Forearm-Worn Skin Stretch Display for Bare-Hand Interaction in AR/VR},
  author={Taejun Kim and Youngbo Aram Shim and Youngin Kim and Sunbum Kim and Jaeyeon Lee and Geehyuk Lee},
  abstract={The paradigm of bare-hand interaction has become increasingly prevalent in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) environments, propelled by advancements in hand tracking technology. However, a significant challenge arises in delivering haptic feedback to users’ hands, due to the necessity for the hands to remain bare. In response to this challenge, recent research has proposed an indirect solution of providing haptic feedback to the forearm. In this work, we present QuadStretcher, a skin stretch display featuring four independently controlled stretching units surrounding the forearm. While achieving rich haptic expression, our device also eliminates the need for a grounding base on the forearm by using a pair of counteracting tactors, thereby reducing bulkiness. To assess the effectiveness of QuadStretcher in facilitating immersive bare-hand experiences, we conducted a comparative user evaluation (n = 20) with a baseline solution, Squeezer. The results confirmed that QuadStretcher outperformed Squeezer in terms of expressing force direction and heightening the sense of realism, particularly in 3-DoF VR interactions such as pulling a rubber band, hooking a fishing rod, and swinging a tennis racket. We further discuss the design insights gained from qualitative user interviews, presenting key takeaways for future forearm-haptic systems aimed at advancing AR/VR bare-hand experiences.},

  author={Bingxu Li and Jaeyeon Lee and Gregory J. Gerling},
  abstract={While often focused on our visual system, adding touch to VR/AR environments can help render more immersive, richer user experiences. One important touch percept to render is compliance, or ‘softness.’ Herein, we evaluate the perceptibility of soft, magnetorheological elastomers (MRE) in bare-finger interactions. Such materials can be reprogrammed to distinct states of compliance. We fabricated MRE samples over elastic moduli from 23–173 kPa and measured that small 0.25 T magnetic fields increased modulus by 10–60 kPa. MRE interfaces less and more compliant than finger skin were evaluated in discrimination experiments with and without a magnetic field. The results indicate changes in modulus of 11 kPa are required to reach a 75% threshold of discrimination, although greater differences are required when an MRE’s elasticity is about the same as skin. The perceptual results with these magnetically-induced materials are similar to those with non-actuated, solid silicone-elastomers that mimic naturalistic interactions.},

  title={Augmenting on-body touch input with tactile feedback through fingernail haptics},
  author={Peter Khoa Duc Tran and Purna Valli Anusha Gadepalli and Jaeyeon Lee and Aditya Shekhar Nittala},
  abstract={The key assumption attributed to on-body touch input is that the skin being touched provides natural tactile feedback. In this paper, we for the first time systematically explore augmenting on-body touch input with computer-generated tactile feedback. We employ vibrotactile actuation on the fingernail to couple on-body touch input with tactile feedback. Results from our first experiment show that users prefer tactile feedback for on-body touch input. In our second experiment, we determine the frequency thresholds for rendering realistic tactile “click” sensations for on-body touch buttons on three different body locations. Finally, in our third experiment, we dig deeper to render highly expressive tactile effects with a single actuator. Our non-metric multi-dimensional analysis shows that haptic augmentation of on-body buttons enhances the expressivity of on-body touch input. Overall, results from our experiments reinforce the need for tactile feedback for on-body touch input and show that actuation on the fingernail is a promising approach.},

  author={Nari Kim and Sangsu Jang and Hansol Kim and Jaeyeon Lee and Young-Woo Park},
  abstract={Being a little more careful about the sound that people produce is difficult in shared houses because individuals can generate several unintended living noises and sounds. We designed Tunee to help each housemate better understand the others’ context and desired noise-level. It is an interactive speaker that allows people to share noise-level preferences through the position change of nodes. Our three-week in-field study with four groups of participants revealed that expressing noise-level preference through nodes reduced the burden of verbally delivering issues about the trivial noises of everyday life, and the intentions of the lowered preference were referred to and deemed significant. We also identified how participants figured out what behavior was acceptable for others according to each noise-level. Our findings imply considerations in designing interfaces to support coordinating behaviors and awareness of social contexts in shared spaces.},
